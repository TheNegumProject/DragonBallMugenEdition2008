Vegeta GT 50% BETA RELEASE (PUBLIC)
www.hyperionx.net
www.zgteam.cjb.net

This is the update to the existing Vegeta GT. Totally redesigning all the sprites, it can transform SSJ and then go SSJ4. Each mode has different moves, although some will be the same, but not all, if some. Because of the lack of time, I'm going to release a additional update which fixes the SSJ4 sprites (later in the future) so it will look like the anime Vegeta ^__^!

If you downloaded this and have read what it said above, don't worry if it hasn't got much in it. This is only a SAMPLE of what I have created [when you downloaded this the one I have on my computer is MUCH more better with LOTS of moves and other stuff, but are too buggy]

UPDATES WILL BE DONE, and very quick too. [Because I wanted to see what people think of this  early version of the character, so while I work on it I'll take suggestions from people and do a even bigger update [with all the moves and such]].

I hope people don't find this character crap, I put a lot of work into making those features that is has.

NOTE: This character is NOT designed to be played by the COM of any sort. It has NO Artificial Intelligence built into it, and because of this, he will play quite thick is given the control of the default AI system. Please do NOT say that he gets his ass kicked, as I have now said it, don't let the AI play him until I develop the skills to create an AI system.

UPDATES IN 50% V1.0 BETA VERSION 
MANY MANY thanks to The NEcromancer, he helped me fixed a REALLY REALLY Critical BUG for Vegeta GT, which is when you fight sometimes, you get cloned for no reason. Also you'll sometimes find yourself stuck for no reason, well I FIXED IT ALL IN THIS VERSION! Well this is only a CRITICAL UPDATE so it's got no new moves what so ever, until I finish my exams I doubt there'd be anything more I'll be adding for him between now and June, but if I get some time, I'll try to work on it.

UPDATES IN 50% BETA version
Added new moves
fixed some bugs
You now get life [back] when you go to a new level of SSJ - to counter his weaknesses
Some effects added to other moves
Added in Zanzoken

Features:
Backflip - Evade attacks and also get out of the "lie down" state [like a recovery roll for those capcom players]
Evade Back/Forwards - By holding on to Z and then tapping forward or backward, you can do a dash evade, which will allow you to evade the move. Good for appearing behind someone too.
Counter Attacks - If you're getting hit and have enough power to pull off a counter hit, by doing so will stop the enemy from comboing you.
3 modes of play - Normal, SSj and SSj4, each mode having different attacks. The SSj4 mode has a different style of play too. While in Normal/SSJ you double tap backwards to do a backflip, in this mode you simply dash back, because of the power in SSj4, backflips are not neccasary.
Counter Attacks - Only one built in so far...find it yourself :P
Turn Back Normal - Yes, no matter which mode you're in [SSj/SSj4] you can turn back normal, but you'll have to build up power to transform again.
Most moves from the old version - yet one or 2 hasn't been added yet...
Anime Move in GT - Final Shine Attack

NEXT VERSION [UPDATE WILL BEGIN AFTER JUNE 23RD]
